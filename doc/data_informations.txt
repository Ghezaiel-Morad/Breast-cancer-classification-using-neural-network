Data Set Information:
Samples (instances) are stored row-wise. Variables (attributes) of each sample are RNA-Seq gene expression levels measured by illumina HiSeq platform.

Attribute Information:
A dummy name (gene_XX) is given to each attribute. Check the original submission ([Web Link]#!Synapse:syn4301332), or the platform specs for the complete list of probes name. The attributes are ordered consitently with the original submission.
